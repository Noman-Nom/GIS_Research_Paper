# Glacier Classification using Machine Learning and Remote Sensing

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project focuses on the **classification of glaciers in Pakistan**, particularly in the Hunza and Karakoram regions, using **remote sensing data** and **machine learning** techniques. It combines multispectral, thermal, SAR, and textural features to accurately classify **clean glaciers**, **debris-covered glaciers**, and **non-glaciated terrain**.

## ✅ What We've Done So Far

### 📦 Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Acquired and cleaned a 500MB+ remote sensing dataset
- Extracted features from:
  - **Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8** bands
  - **Texture features (GLCM)**
  - **Spectral indices**: NDVI, NDSI, NDWI, NBR
  - **LST and SAR backscatter**
- Balanced dataset across classes (0 = non-glacier, 1 = glacier, 2 = debris-covered)

### 🤖 Modeling
- Trained and evaluated:
  - **Random Forest (RF)**
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**
- Performed **spatial validation** (trained on one region, tested on another)

### 📊 Results
- **ANN outperformed other models**, achieving **~96% accuracy** on unseen glacier regions
- SVM and RF struggled with debris vs. non-glaciated terrain
- Demonstrated model generalization across space

## 🚀 What’s Coming Next

### 🌍 Data Expansion
- Add more samples (goal: 100K+)
- Include glaciers from Baltoro, Siachen, Skardu, Chitral
- Integrate **multi-temporal satellite imagery**

### 🗺 Feature Improvements
- Incorporate **DEM-based features**: slope, curvature, elevation
- Add **flow direction / hydrologic layers**

### 🤖 Deep Learning Upgrade
- Move to **DeepLabV3+** or **U-Net** for pixel-wise segmentation
- Optionally build a **ViT + CNN hybrid** (like GlaViTU architecture)

### 🧪 Uncertainty Estimation & Confidence Maps
- Use dropout-based Bayesian inference to **quantify prediction certainty**

### 📦 Output & Visualization
- Generate **classified GeoTIFF maps**
- Export to QGIS or WebGIS for real-time glacier monitoring

## 📌 Goal
Build a **state-of-the-art, scalable glacier classification system** for high mountain Asia that can be used for climate monitoring, water resource planning, and academic research.
